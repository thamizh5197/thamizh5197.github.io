## Shorter Loop — 0→1 Product Direction

**Early-stage discovery platform for product teams**

Joined as **sole UX Designer**, evolved into product ownership after identifying a gap between roadmap assumptions and what users would actually pay for.

**Result:** secured first customer and helped raise **$250K funding**.

## Problem
Discovery workflows were fragmented → insights weren’t turning into decisions.

## Constraints
0→1 stage · limited engineering bandwidth · unclear product direction

## Approach
- Led interviews & research to ground decisions in evidence  
- Reframed roadmap from **features → workflows**  
- Replaced complex whiteboard plan with simpler structured validation  
- Simplified onboarding & guided activation  
- Introduced AI-assisted insight synthesis  

## Impact
- **Activation ↑ 80%**  
- **First paying customer**  
- **$250K funding secured**  
- Shift to research-driven product decisions  
- Transitioned into product leadership
