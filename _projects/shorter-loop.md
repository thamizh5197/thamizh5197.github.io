Shorter Loop was an early-stage startup helping product teams run continuous discovery. I joined as the sole UX Designer and later transitioned into Product Management after leading research, strategy, and roadmap planning.

During my time, we raised **\$250K in funding**, launched new capabilities, and signed our **first paying customer** giving me hands-on 0-to-1 product experience.

### My Role & Approach

* Identified gaps between roadmap and user needs, reframing discussions from “what features to add” to “what problems are we solving?”
* Led user research (interviews, surveys, competitive analysis) to uncover pain points in feedback management and collaboration
* Proposed and validated a new roadmap centered on reducing tool fatigue with in-app docs, whiteboarding, and structured planning features
* Designed core features end-to-end, including persona canvases, feedback manager, and strategy frameworks
* Introduced generative AI into the product for feedback analysis, persona generation, and story drafting
* Partnered with founders on GTM prep, demos, and investor pitches

### The Impact

* Helped raise **\$250K in funding** by aligning product vision with market needs
* Designed and shipped key collaboration and strategy features that improved product clarity and adoption
* Brought AI into the product early, creating strong differentiators for demos and customers
* Acquired the **first paying customer**, kickstarting traction and validation
* Transitioned from UX to Product Management by driving not just *how* we built, but *what* and *why*

This experience shaped how I think about product leadership from discovery and design through to strategy, execution, and go-to-market.
