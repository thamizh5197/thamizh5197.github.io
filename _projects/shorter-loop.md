Shorter Loop was an early-stage startup helping product teams run continuous discovery. I joined as the sole UX Designer and gradually stepped into product ownership after identifying a misalignment between what we were building and what users were actually willing to pay for.

During my time, we raised **$250K in funding** and signed our **first paying customer**. My role evolved from designing features to shaping product direction, prioritization, and validation in a 0→1 environment with limited engineering bandwidth.

### My Role & Approach

* Brought evidence into product decisions by leading user interviews, surveys, and competitive research
* Identified gaps between roadmap assumptions and real user workflows, reframing discussions from *feature output* to *problem alignment*
* Challenged technically heavy solutions (like a planned whiteboard feature) in favor of simpler structures to validate workflows faster and with lower engineering cost
* Redesigned onboarding to reduce cognitive overload and guide users toward meaningful first actions, improving activation by **80%**
* Designed core discovery and strategy features end-to-end, balancing usability with feasibility in a small team
* Introduced practical AI-assisted workflows to help teams synthesize feedback and move faster from insight to action
* Partnered with founders on demos, positioning, and early GTM efforts

### The Impact

* Helped secure **$250K in funding** by aligning product direction with validated market needs
* Contributed to signing the **first paying customer**, moving the product from concept to commercial validation
* Shifted the team from assumption-led to research-informed product decisions
* Transitioned from UX Designer to Product Manager by taking ownership of not just *how* we built, but *what* and *why*

This experience shaped how I approach product design today: validate early, simplify aggressively, and design within real-world constraints rather than ideal conditions.
