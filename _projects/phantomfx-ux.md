Phantom FX first approached me for freelance work on their internal production management system. After reviewing the tool and its impact on day-to-day studio operations, I proposed a full system rethink rather than a surface-level UI redesign. I later joined full-time to lead the transformation.

The system was responsible for coordinating **200+ VFX artists and 15+ managers** across projects containing **10,000+ tasks each**. It was slow, confusing, and largely avoided by teams, with a System Usability Scale score below 10.

### My Role & Approach

* Conducted cross-department research to understand how production actually worked, not just how the software expected it to work
* Discovered that the biggest issues were structural: rigid task logic, poor visibility into workloads, and heavy reliance on Excel outside the system
* Reframed the challenge from a UI cleanup to a workflow and information architecture redesign
* Simplified the system by introducing role-based dashboards, flexible subtasks, and on-demand data loading instead of heavy table views
* Replaced manual resource tracking spreadsheets with a **Gantt-style scheduling view** that made artist availability and workload visible
* Standardized terminology and removed unnecessary data fields to reduce cross-team confusion
* Established a design system suited to the studio’s working environment, improving consistency and usability

### The Impact

* Increased adoption from under 10% to widespread daily use across departments
* Improved System Usability Scale score from below 10 to **90+**
* Reduced reliance on parallel Excel workflows by bringing real operational visibility into the product
* Turned a frustrating internal tool into a trusted system that supported production planning and decision-making

This project taught me how deeply design can influence operational efficiency — not just by improving interfaces, but by aligning systems with how people actually work.
