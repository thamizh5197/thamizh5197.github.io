## Production Workflow Transformation

**Internal production system for a VFX studio**

Initially brought in for a UI refresh, I proposed a full system rethink after uncovering operational breakdowns. Joined full-time to redesign how 200+ artists and 15+ managers coordinate ~10,000 tasks per film project.

**Result:** transformed a failing tool into a trusted operational system.

#### Problem
The production tool didn’t reflect real studio workflows → teams relied on Excel and workarounds.

#### Constraints
Legacy backend · live production environment · heavy datasets · cross-department needs

#### Approach
- Conducted cross-functional research across 8 departments  
- Reframed UI cleanup into workflow & system redesign  
- Rebuilt information architecture around real operations  
- Introduced Gantt-based scheduling to replace Excel tracking  
- Optimized data loading to reduce performance bottlenecks  
- Standardized terminology & reduced cognitive noise  
- Designed role-specific dashboards & operational metrics  

## Impact
- Adoption increased from **<10% → 97%**  
- System Usability Scale improved to **90+**  
- Eliminated parallel Excel workflows  
- Significantly improved load performance  
- Enabled real-time operational visibility
