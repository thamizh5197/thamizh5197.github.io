In early 2021, Phantom FX approached me for freelance work on their internal project management tool. After exploring the product and its impact on workflows, I saw an opportunity to make a deeper impact and joined full-time as a UI/UX Designer.

The tool was critical for managing 400+ VFX artists and 15+ managers across projects with 10,000+ tasks each. But it was slow (10+ minute load times), confusing (inconsistent UI, poor information architecture), and nearly unusable (SUS score <10).

## My Role & Approach

* Led user research across departments to uncover pain points in workflows and tool usage
* Reframed the problem from a UI facelift to a full UX and system redesign
* Simplified information architecture with role-based dashboards, subtasks, and modal-based task views
* Streamlined data handling to reduce load times dramatically
* Added visual metrics, Gantt charts, and dashboards to make progress, budget, and schedules easier to understand
* Established a design system with dark mode (the studioâ€™s working environment), consistent icons, and clear feedback states

## The Impact

* Turned a failing tool into a reliable daily driver for 400+ artists and 15+ managers
* Improved usability across departments, aligning tech with real workflows
* Boosted the System Usability Scale score from below 10 to **90**

This project showed me how much a well-designed system can transform not just usability, but also collaboration and morale in a high-pressure creative environment.
