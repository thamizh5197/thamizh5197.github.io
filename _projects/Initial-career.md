After completing my Master’s in Software Engineering, I realized that while I could code, I didn’t enjoy it enough to see myself pursuing it long term. I took time to explore where my interests truly lay and found that UX design combined what I loved most: technology, design, psychology, and empathy for people.

Before joining larger companies, I built my foundation as a designer through personal projects, freelance work, and collaborations with smaller businesses. These experiences gave me hands-on exposure to the full design process and helped me develop the core skills I carry into my work today.

## My Role & Approach

* Revamped websites to improve usability, structure, and aesthetics
* Designed both **web and mobile applications**, including everyday products like grocery apps
* Created **information architectures, wireframes, and prototypes** to shape user flows and product functionality
* Conducted **user interviews and usability testing sessions** to gather feedback and validate design choices
* Built **design systems** to bring consistency and scalability to client projects
* Presented directly to clients, translating business needs into practical design solutions
* published a personal project app to the Play Store

## The Impact

* Delivered functional, user-friendly websites and apps that helped small teams and startups improve their digital presence
* Introduced structured design practices (design systems, testing, IA) where none existed before
* Developed a strong foundation in client communication, research, and end-to-end product design
* Built the skills and confidence that enabled me to transition into larger companies and more complex product challenges
* Released a personal project app on the Play Store that earned a 4.5★ rating, validating both design quality and user value

This phase of my career was less about recognition and more about building the craft learning how to solve real problems, adapt quickly, and grow into the designer I am today.
