## Early Career — Building My Design Foundation

**From software engineering to UX design**

After completing my Master’s in Software Engineering, I realized my strengths aligned more with designing solutions than writing code. I began exploring UX through personal projects, freelance work, and collaborations with small businesses.

This phase built the foundation of my design thinking, research skills, and end-to-end product approach.

#### Problem
Small teams needed usable, structured digital products but lacked design expertise and process.

#### Constraints
Limited budgets · fast timelines · undefined requirements · no existing design systems

#### Approach
- Redesigned websites to improve usability, structure, and clarity  
- Designed web & mobile apps, including everyday utility products  
- Created information architecture, wireframes, and interactive prototypes  
- Conducted user interviews and usability testing to validate decisions  
- Built design systems to ensure consistency and scalability  
- Collaborated directly with clients to translate business needs into practical solutions  
- Published a personal project app to the Play Store  

#### Impact
- Delivered user-friendly products that improved digital presence for small teams  
- Introduced structured design practices where none existed  
- Built strong foundations in research, UX thinking, and client communication  
- Developed end-to-end product design capability  
- Released a Play Store app with a **4.5★ rating**, validating real user value
